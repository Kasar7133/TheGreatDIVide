# TheGreatDIVide
A team matchmaking app for video games.

Nick Notes: 
- make sure that a user cant join a game twice 
- refactor the game session and make it into a game_post serializer 
- add a comments to a game post 
- add a "games" table. A game can have many game_posts. add a games index page
- game show page shows all of the game_posts for that game
